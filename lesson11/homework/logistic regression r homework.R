# question 1
#please load GradSchools dataset
# change rank to factor 

# question 2
# target is the admit
# the other variables are predictors
#Fitting the logistic regression with all variables; the family parameter
#specifies the error distribution and link function to be used. For logistic
#regression, this is binomial.

# question 3
# Investigating the overall fit of the model.
# explain the coefficeints on the log odds scale.

# question 4
# expleian the coefficents on the odds scale.

# question 5
# Generating confidence intervals for the coefficients on the log odds scale.

# question 6
# Generating confidence intervals for the coefficients on the odds scale.

# question 7
#Do the categories for rank add any predictive power to the model? Let's
#drop it from the model, which model is better based accuracy.
