# Missingness, Imputation, & KNN
# author: shuo zhang

#Load the  titanic3 dataset from the  PASWRlibrary; this dataset describes 
# the survival status of individual passengers from the Titanic voyage. 
#There are 14 different variables, some of which have quite a bit of missingness.

#-MCAR: We only have one missing fare observation. It could be the case that this
#       one value is missing because of human error or a simple mistake in data
#       entry.
#-MAR: There is a lot of missingness in the body identification number variable.
#      We notice that there is a relationship between the survived variable and
#      the body variable. It appears as though observations only received a body
#      id if the individual did not survive.
#-MNAR: (Supposition) Elder voyagers might have perished more easily because of
#       their lower mobility. As a result, their ages were not captured as
#       easily by the researchers. The missing values of age depend on the value
#       of age itself.
